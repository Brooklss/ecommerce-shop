---- ✅ **Infinite Scroll Pagination** - Automatic loading with `?limit=10&skip=10`- ✅ **Search Functionality** - Search products by name



## 🌐 Deployment### Authentication (Mock System)



### Vercel (Current Deployment)- Any username/password works for demo purposes### Deploy to GitHub Pages

The application is deployed on Vercel at: [https://bcommerce-shop.vercel.app/](https://bcommerce-shop.vercel.app/)

- Login state persists in localStorage

**Features:**

- Automatic deployments on git push- Protected routes require authentication# Run development server

- Preview URLs for branches

- Full Next.js support (SSR, dynamic routes)- User-specific features unlocked when logged in

- Zero configuration required

See detailed instructions in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)

### Deploy Your Own

1. Fork this repository### Product Management

2. Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)

3. Import your forked repository- **View All Products**: API products + your created productsnpm run dev- ✅ **Product Search** - Real-time search without page refresh- ✅ **Infinite Scroll Pagination** - Load more products on scroll

4. Click "Deploy"

5. Done! Your app will be live in ~1 minute- **Create**: POST to DummyJSON + save to localStorage



---- **Edit**: PATCH to API + update localStorage (YOUR products only)**Quick Steps**:



## 🐛 Troubleshooting- **Delete**: DELETE from API + remove from localStorage (YOUR products only)



### "Failed to update product"1. Push code to GitHub

**Cause:** You're trying to edit a product you don't own.  

**Solution:** Only products YOU created (with crown badge) can be edited.### Why localStorage?



### Port 3000 already in useDummyJSON is a mock API that doesn't persist data. We use localStorage to simulate a real database for your created products and favorites.2. Go to Settings → Pages

```bash

npx kill-port 3000

# or

npm run dev -- -p 3001## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Product Editing3. Source: Select **"GitHub Actions"**# Build for production- ✅ **Category Filter** - Filter products by category dropdown

```



### Module not found errors

```bash**You can ONLY edit/delete products YOU created!**4. GitHub Actions will auto-deploy on every push

rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

npm install

```

Products from the DummyJSON API (IDs 1-194) belong to the store and cannot be modified.npm run build

### Technical Features- ✅ Dark Mode Toggle- ✅ **Mock Authentication** - Login page to access protected features- ✅ **Dark Mode Toggle** - Switch between light and dark themes using Redux

### ⚠️ GitHub Pages (Limited Support)

- ✅ Redux Toolkit State Management

**Not Recommended**: GitHub Pages only supports static sites. Your app has dynamic routes (`/product/[id]`) that require a Node.js server.

- ✅ localStorage Persistence- ✅ Responsive Design (Mobile/Tablet/Desktop)

**Limitations**:

- ❌ Dynamic routes won't work properly- ✅ TypeScript Type Safety

- ❌ Product detail pages will 404

- ❌ Edit pages will fail- ✅ RESTful API Integration- ✅ Local Storage Persistence- ✅ **Mock Authentication** - Login page with persistent authentication state

- ❌ No server-side features

- ✅ Static Site Generation

If you still want to try GitHub Pages, you'll need to implement fallback routing and static generation, but it's not ideal for this app.

- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD- ✅ Placeholder Images for User-Created Products
